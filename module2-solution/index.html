                    <h3>Chicken</h3>
                </div>
               <p>Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Rinse a whole chicken and pat it dry with paper towels. Rub the chicken all over with olive oil and season generously with salt and pepper. Stuff the cavity with a few sprigs of fresh thyme, a halved lemon, and a few garlic cloves. Tie the legs together with kitchen twine and place the chicken in a roasting pan. Roast the chicken for about 1 hour and 20 minutes, or until the skin is golden brown and the juices run clear when a thigh is pierced with a knife. Let the chicken rest for 10-15 minutes before carving and serving. Enjoy!

            <h3>Beef</h3>
        </div>
        <p>In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat some oil over medium-high heat. Season beef stew meat with salt and pepper, then brown it in the pot, stirring occasionally. Remove the beef from the pot and set it aside. Add some chopped onions, carrots, and celery to the pot and cook until the vegetables are tender. Stir in some tomato paste, minced garlic, and a few sprigs of fresh thyme. Pour in enough beef broth or stock to cover the ingredients and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat and let the stew simmer for about 2-3 hours.Enjoy!</p>

            <h3>Sushi</h3>
        </div>
        <p>Cook sushi rice according to package instructions and let it cool to room temperature. Lay a sheet of nori shiny side down on a bamboo sushi mat. Wet your hands with water and spread a thin layer of rice over the nori, leaving a 1-inch border at the top edge. Arrange thin slices of your desired ingredients (such as avocado, cucumber, cooked shrimp, or smoked salmon) in a line across the center of the rice. Use the bamboo mat to tightly roll up the sushi, using the border of rice at the top to seal the roll. Repeat with remaining ingredients. Slice the rolls into rounds using a sharp, wet knife and serve. Enjoy!</p>
